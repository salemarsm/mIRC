
THE HANDY DANDY ANALOGX NETSTAT LIVE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Have you ever been browsing the internet, and things just seem a bit slower
than they normally do?  Ever wonder just how directly you connect to another
server on the internet?  How about just wanting to know whether or not you're
sending and receiving data on a cable modem or other high-speed connection?
If you're like me, then these thoughts have probably crossed your mind more
than once... It sure would be wonderful if someone could solve this problem,
and make the world just a little bit better.  Once again, AnalogX comes to
the rescue with AnalogX NetStat LIVE!

AnalogX NetStat Live (or NSL) is a super easy to use, fast, and effective way
to monitor your internet connection status and system performance.  It graphs
the last 60 seconds of data throughput, displaying the average datarate, the
total amount of data sent since last reboot, and the maximum datarate.  It
tracks these for all incoming and outgoing messages, so you don't need to worry
about configuring your browser or other programs to work with it - it just does
it automatically!


    :::The Display:::
The NSL window is split into several section; any of the pane's inside the
window can be turned on or off to help customize the look of the program to
exactly what you want.  To enable or disable a pane, simply right click on
the NSL window, and choose 'Statistics' from the menu - anything with a check
next to it will be displayed.  Here's a list of the pane's currently available:

    Local Machine:      This shows the current machine name, IP address, and
                        network interface being monitored
    Remote Machine:     This shows information regarding a remote machine,
                        including average ping time and number of hops
    Incoming Totals:    This shows totals for the incoming data
    Incoming:           This shows the total amount of data on the incoming
                        (download) channel
    Outgoing Totals:    This shows totals for the outgoing data
    Outgoing:           This shows the total amount of data on the outgoing
                        (upload) channel
    Threads:            This shows the total number of threads currently
                        running in the system
    CPU:                This graphs the CPU load (this does not work on WinNT
                        and Win2k yet)

The graphs automatically adjust themselves to whatever bandwidth you have
available to you, so the number indicated as the 'maximum' value will be the
very top of the graph.  If a value larger than the current maximum comes in,
the graph will automatically adjust to make this the new top value.  If you
want to, you can 'Reset' the graphs and values to zero to get a clean reading
of the current performance.

The values displayed (current, average, and maximum) are shown in three
different ways; if the value is less than 1024 bytes, it will have a 'B'
after it.  If it's more than 1024 bytes, then it will have a 'KB' after it;
and finally if it's greater than 1024KB it will have an 'MB' after it (for
megabyte).  It's also important to note that the current value is your current
throughput, it will tend to jump around, so the it's usually better to rely
on the average value.  The average value, which is an average of the last 60
seconds, is your best indicator of how fast your connection is.  You may also
notice a light line on the graph; this is the current average line.

You may have noticed that the remote network info has a machine listed, and
some info pertaining to it... Would you like to know how to change the server?
Just open up your browser, go to a webpage, and copy the url (including the
http://) into the clipboard (by hitting CTRL-C).  Now look at NSL... Notice
anything?  The server will now be replaced with whatever you had in the
clipboard!


    :::Configuration:::
NSL can also be configure to operate in several different ways from the Config
menu.  First, you can set it to 'Auto Minimize'; this means when the program
starts up, it will automatically show up on the system tray instead of a big
window on the screen.  Next, you can have it 'Auto Start', which will cause it
to automatically run every time you reboot your machine (great to use with the
auto minimize option).  Another option is 'URL ClipCap', with this turned on,
NetStat will scan the clipboard for URL's, and if it finds one it will auto-
matically ping/traceroute it.  With the 'Always on Top' option, the NSL dialog
will be always above of other windows, so you can see the information no matter
what else is on the screen.  Finally, you can select which TCP/IP interface
the program will monitor, or have it monitor all the interfaces - selection
is made based on the IP address of the interface (and if the interface can't
be found for some reason, it defaults back to ALL).

If you minimize NSL, it will appear on the system tray (the small box on the
right edge of the task bar, on the bottom of the screen.  The icon shows the
status of the connection with the small triangle on the bottom of the icon.
If it is green, it's received or send data within the last 60 seconds, if it
is yellow, it hasn't had any network activity for 60 seconds to 120 seconds,
and if it hasn't had any activity after that, it turns red.  If the left
portion of the icon lights up white, then it's sending data, and if the right
portion lights up white, then it's receiving data.  You can maximize the app
again simply by left clicking on the icon, or you can bring up a small menu
of options by right clicking on it.


    :::Tips:::
A couple points of interest about the program.  First, it tracks all network
activity; this means you can see how quickly data moves across your local
network as well (as long as you're using TCP/IP).  This also means that when
it's used on a modem connection, you're seeing your actual throughput, not
just what the dialup networking adapter or modem SAYS it's doing.  The upside
is that you'll see exactly what kind of performance you're getting while you
are browsing around webpages.  If you are interested in seeing exactly how
fast you connection is, the best way is to download a binary file (make sure
it will take more than 1 minute), and then look at the average reported.
Because this program uses this technique, it means it's compatible with not
only modems, but cable modems, DSL's, even network connections!

The monthly incoming/outgoing totals are only accurate if you leave NSL running
ALL the time, and do not exit the program before rebooting - this is KEY!  If
you exit the program before rebooting, then it will not store the current usage.

    :::Troubleshooting:::
If you encounter the error 'Couldn't load inetmib1.dll (0x0000001F) (31)',
then it incredibly descriptive error (provided by Microsoft) is:

    It was unable to start a connected device for some reason.

There's no way (that I'm aware of) to get any more info about who, what, why,
or where the problem arises from... I contacted Microsoft about it, and they
say that it's usually caused by either a faulty network install, improperly
written driver, or an unused or duplicate driver entry.

If you're running Windows95, and get the message that it can't find the DLL
'snmpapi.dll', then you need to go to microsoft and download the Winsock and
Winsock2 updates that they have available (in the Networking Tools section).
You can find these at:

http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/

If you're running to the message that it can't find the DLL 'inetmib1.dll',
then you need to download the Dialup Networking Upgrade as well as the updates
mentioed above.

If you're running WinNT/2k, the CPU graph is not currently operational.  This
functionality will be added in one of the next releases.
