    Properties: nick, addr, ip. $dns(N) without a property returns the

176.Added Multi-Server support. mIRC now allows you to connect to
    multiple servers at the same time.

    This feature required major internal changes to mIRC code and
    forced improvement of code in many areas which has hopefully
    resulted in a more stable/robust mIRC.

    Added "New server window" checkbox to connect dialog. To open
    a new server window without connecting to a server, you can
    check the "New Server Window" checkbox and press the OK button.

    Added "New Server Window" menu item to options toolbar button
    servers popup menu. You can also open a new server window by
    holding down the Shift key when you select a server from the
    popup menu.

    Added multi-server dialog to connect/options dialog.

    New commands and identifiers:

      $cid - returns server connection id for current script
      $wid - returns window id for current script

      $status - returns server connection status. Also returns
                "closing" during the on disconnect event if the
                status window being closed is the cause of the
                disconnection.

      $activecid, and $lactivecid.

      $scid(N)[.command], where N is a $cid value
      $scon(N)[.command], where N is the Nth connection

      If N = 0, returns total number of open status windows.

      You can also specify a property which is a command name
      and it will be called using that server connection.

      /scid <-rsatM | N> [command], where N is a $cid value
      /scon <-rsatM | N> [command], where N is the Nth connection

      If you specify a command, the connection id is set only for
      that command. The -r switch resets the connection id to the
      original id for that script.

      The -a and -tM switches can only be used if you specify a
      command.

         -a - perform the command on all connection ids.

        -tM - where M is an or'd value of 1 = server connected,
              2 = not connected, 4 = connecting, 8 = not connecting.
              The command is only performed if N matches the connect
              status of the connection id.

      Note: if you use a command that contains $identifiers, and
      you want the identifiers to be evaluated in the target
      connection, you must pass them as $!identifier to prevent
      them from being evaulated first in the current connection.

    Also added new properties to $window():

      .type - returns window type name

    And to $query(), $window(), $chat(), $send(), $get(), $chan(),
    and $timer():

      .cid  - server connection id
      .wid  - window id
      .hwnd - window handle

    Added /server -mn switches, where -m creates a new server window
    and connects, -n creates new server window without connecting.

    Misc. notes:

    Windows whose server connection has been closed are placed
    at the end of the switchbar list. This includes things like
    dcc send/get/chat, and custom windows.

    Everything in mIRC now has a unique id number, all windows,
    server connections, dcc sends/get/chats, etc.

    The tray icon displays the animation for the current active
    server connection, same goes for the Connect toolbar button,
    and File menu.

    Each server connection has it's own /play list, and the play
    dialog shows the play list for the current active connection.

    URLs list "Send To" menu, and Tray popup menu, show the network
    and nickname for each status window.

177.Added /timer -i switch, makes a timer auto-associate with the
    currently active server connection.

    The -i switch keeps the /timer alive across server windows,
    if a server window is closed, the /timer just picks a new one
    automatically.

    /timer now shows the associated network name for a timer.

    You can use $timer().anysc to check if it has the -i switch
    enabled.

178.on PLAYEND is now triggered at the end of each played file.
179.Extended /ignore, /protect, etc. handling.

    Changed display format in Control dialog listbox.

    /ignore, /protect, /aop, and /avoice now all by default
    include a network name, unless you use the -w switch.

    /ignore -l now displays the unignore time.

    /ignore -l, when you're not connected to a server, lists all
    ignores. When connected, it lists all ignores that apply to
    that connection.

    Added .network property to $ignore()/$protect/$aop()/$avoice().

    Also note that isaop, isavoice, isignore, and isprotect all
    apply to the current connection.

180.Added /window switches:

    When a @window is created, it is automatically associated
    with the current connection. If that connection is closed,
    the @window is associated with the next available connection.

    You can change this behaviour with /window -ivz:

    -i - makes a @window dynamically associate with the currently
         active connection. You can use $window().anysc to check
         if this setting is active.

    -v - closes window when associated status window is closed
         The on close event is triggered for the window.

         If this switch isn't used and the status window is
         closed, the @window is moved to the end of the switchbar,
         and is associated with the first available status window.

    -z - places window button at end of switchbar

181.The . prefix now makes /debug quiet. Extended /debug to allow
    output to a custom @window or filename.

    /debug [-cnpt] [N] [on | off | @window | filename]

    /debug -c off    closes associated @window
    /debug -n @moo   opens @window minimized
    /debug -pt       wrap or timestamp text
    /debug N @moo    use color N for text

    $debug returns name of debug file or @window.

    /debug now works independently for each server connection,
    indents lines if not wrapped, and prefixes each line with
    the server address, and <- and ->.

    /debug @window now also works with listbox @windows.

182.Active switchbar button now uses bold text and shaded background.
183.Using new path-splitting routines which affect eg. $nopath().
184.Auto-tile/cascade/arrange are no longer triggered when you close
    a desktop window.
185.Fixed switchbar/toolbar display glitch when mIRC window is sized
    to a very small height.
186.Fixed $findfile() bug when handling wildcards with numbers.
187.$chan is now filled for the on ctcpreply event if it was a channel
    ctcp message.
188.Ctcp messages that use an invalid format are now treated as plain
    text, and will trigger script events.
189.Added "Control+Tab uses switchbar order" to General dialog.
